# üîê `pw` - Terminal Password Manager powered by `fzf`

`pw` is a command-line password manager unifying trusted password managers
like [macOS Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services),
[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) and [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org) in a single interface within the terminal.
It combines the security of your favourite password managers with the speed and
simplicity of the [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) fuzzy finder and allows
you to interact with [various keychains](#example-using-multiple-keychains) effortlessly.

# Why `pw`?

- **Unified Interface:** `pw` unifies trusted password managers in a single terminal interface.
- **Efficiency:** With the [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) fuzzy finder, `pw` allows for rapid and intuitive interaction with your keychains - nice!
- **Simplicity:** `pw` is built using simple bash, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
- **Extensibility:** Adding plugins for your preferred password managers takes only minutes (see [plugins](src/plugins)).
- **Clipboard Management:** Automatically clears passwords from the clipboard after a specified duration.
- **Multiple Keychain Support**: Effortlessly manage and switch between [multiple keychains](#example-using-multiple-keychains) stored in various locations.

# Quickstart

```bash
# create a keychain (.keychain-db for macOS Keychain, .kdbx for KeePassXC)
pw init ~/secrets.keychain-db

# optionally configure keychains in ~/.pwrc so you can access them from anywhere
# otherwise, pw will discover keychains in the current directory
echo '~/secrets.keychain-db' >> ~/.pwrc

# add an entry
pw add GitHub sschmid

# add another entry interactively
pw add

# copy the password directly by providing the name
pw GitHub

# or use fzf to select an entry (-p prints the password instead of copying it)
pw -p
```

If you would like to manage your passwords yourself, you can use `pw` with
GnuPG to store encrypted passwords in a directory:

```bash
# create a keychain
pw init ~/secrets/   # end with `/` for GnuPG
cd ~/secrets

# optionally configure keychains in ~/.pwrc so you can access them from anywhere
# otherwise, pw will discover gpg encrypted passwords in the current directory
echo '~/secrets/' >> ~/.pwrc

# add an entry
# if you haven't configured ~/.pwrc yet, you need to specify the keychain once
# because the directory is empty and pw can't determine the keychain type yet
pw -k ~/secrets add GitHub sschmid

# add another entry interactively
pw add

# output binary format (default)
pw add GitHub.gpg

# output ASCII-armored format
pw add GitHub.asc

# copy the password directly by providing the name
pw GitHub

# or use fzf to select an entry (-p prints the password instead of copying it)
pw -p
```

# Install and update `pw`

```bash
# install
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschmid/pw-terminal-password-manager/main/install)"

# update
pw update

# uninstall
/usr/local/opt/pw/install --uninstall
```

# How `pw` works

`pw` provides a unified interface to interact with various keychains and
forwards commands to the respective password manager using plugins.
Plugins are simple bash scripts that implement the following functions (see [plugins](src/plugins)):

- `init`
- `add`
- `edit`
- `get`
- `show`
- `rm`
- `ls`
- `open`
- `lock`
- `unlock`

Password managers may vary in their capabilities, so `pw` provides a
consistent interface by implementing workarounds where necessary.

Here's an overview of which features are supported by each plugin:

# Usage

In all following examples, `[<args>]` refers to the optional
arguments `name`, `account`, `url`, `notes` in that order.

When using fzf mode to select an entry, such as when getting, editing,
or removing an entry, you can toggle the entry preview by pressing `?`.
The entry preview shows details like the name, account, url, and notes and
is off by default.

Press `CTRL-Y` on any entry to copy (or print) the details.

## Create keychain

```
pw init <keychain>                 create keychain
```

```bash
pw init ~/secrets.keychain-db   # macOS Keychain
pw init ~/secrets.kdbx          # KeePassXC
pw init ~/secrets/              # GnuPG (end with `/` to create a directory)

# macos_keychain special behaviour
pw init secrets.keychain-db            # will create a keychain in ~/Library/Keychains
pw init "${PWD}/secrets.keychain-db"   # will create a keychain in the current directory
```

## Add entry with name and optional account

```
pw add [<args>]                    add entry. If no args, interactive mode
```

```bash
pw add                                      # add interactively
pw add GitHub                               # add entry with name
pw add Google work@example.com              # add entry with name and account
pw add Google personal@example.com
pw add Homepage admin https://example.com   # add entry with name, account, url
pw add Coveralls "" https://coveralls.io "login via GitHub" # add entry with name, url, notes
```

If a plugin doesn't support multiple entries with the same name,
you can add the account to the name:

```bash
pw add "Google (Work)" work@example.com
pw add "Google (Personal)" personal@example.com
```

## Add entry in group

```bash
pw add Coding/GitHub
pw add Coding/JetBrains
```

## Edit entry

```
pw edit [<args>]                   edit entry. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw edit          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw edit GitHub
```

## Get entry

```
pw [-p] [<args>]                   copy (or print) password. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw GitHub
```

## Show entry

```
pw show [-p] [<args>]              copy (or print) details. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw show          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw show GitHub
```

## Remove entry

```
pw rm [<args>]                remove entry. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw rm          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw rm GitHub
```

## Generate a password

```
pw gen [-p] [<length>] [<class>]   generate password with given length and
                                   character class (default: 35 [:graph:])
```

```bash
pw gen                  # equivalent to pw gen 35 '[:graph:]'
pw gen 16
pw gen 24 '[:alnum:]'
pw gen 32 '[:digit:]'
```

## Automatic keychain discovery

`pw` automatically searches for keychains in the current directory. This way
you can keep your keychains in the same directory as your project and `pw` will
automatically discover and use them.

## Specifying a keychain

There are multiple ways to specify a keychain:

```bash
# specify keychain using -k for the current command (overrides PW_KEYCHAIN)
pw -k secrets.keychain-db
```

```bash
# specify keychain for the current command
PW_KEYCHAIN=secrets.keychain-db pw
```

```bash
# export default keychain for the current shell
export PW_KEYCHAIN=secrets.keychain-db
pw
```

## Using multiple keychains

`pw` allows you to interact with multiple keychains from different password
managers. This feature is particularly useful when you have keychains stored
in various locations. You can specify different keychains using the `PW_RC`
configuration file, which defaults to `~/.pwrc`.

To use multiple keychains, add your desired keychains to `~/.pwrc`, e.g.:

```bash
secrets.keychain-db
~/path/to/myproject.keychain-db
~/path/to/keepassxc.kdbx
~/path/to/gpg/secrets
```

After configuring your keychains, continue using `pw` as usual. If no keychain
is specified with `-k` or by setting `PW_KEYCHAIN`, `pw` allows you to select
one from your `~/.pwrc` file using the fuzzy finder.

![pw-fzf](readme/pw-dbs.png)

## Using `pw` in a command or script
Use `pw` to avoid leaking secrets in scripts that you share or commit.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $(pw -p GITHUB_TOKEN)" https://api.github.com/user
```

## Provide passwords via `STDIN`

To avoid password prompts that can interrupt scripts,
you can provide passwords via `STDIN`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Avoid providing passwords in plain text, because they can be
  exposed in process listings, shell history, logs, and through insecure network
  transmissions, making them vulnerable to theft or misuse. Instead, use secure
  methods like environment variables to protect sensitive information.

```bash
echo "${MY_PASSWORD}" | pw init ~/secrets.kdbx
echo "${MY_PASSWORD}" | pw add Google personal@example.com
echo "${MY_PASSWORD}" | pw unlock
```

If your shell supports `STDIN` with here string (like `bash`), you can use it like this:

```bash
pw init ~/secrets.kdbx <<< "${MY_PASSWORD}"
pw add Google personal@example.com <<< "${MY_PASSWORD}"
pw unlock <<< "${MY_PASSWORD}"
```

# Customization

Export or provide the following variables to customize and change `pw`'s default behaviour:

```bash
# Default keychain used when not specified with -k
# otherwise, ~/.pwrc is used to select a keychain with fzf
export PW_KEYCHAIN=secrets.keychain-db

# Default length of generated passwords
export PW_GEN_LENGTH=35

# Default character class for generated passwords
export PW_GEN_CLASS='[:graph:]'

# Time after which the password is cleared from the clipboard
export PW_CLIP_TIME=45

# Path to the configuration file
export PW_RC=~/.mypwrc
```

Configure keychains in `~/.pwrc`

```bash
secrets.keychain-db
~/path/to/myproject.keychain-db
~/path/to/keepassxc.kdbx
~/path/to/gpg/secrets
```

# Plugin specific configuration

Some plugins support additional configuration options by appending them to the
keychain path after a colon `:`, e.g. `/path/to/keychain:key=value`.

This syntax can be used everywhere a keychain is specified, e.g.:

```bash
pw -k ~/secrets.kdbx:key1=value1,key2=value2
```

In your `~/.pwrc`:
```bash
...
~/secrets.kdbx:key1=value1,key2=value2
...
```

## KeePassXC

If you want to use a key file for unlocking the database,
you can specify the path to the key file:

```bash
~/secrets.kdbx:keyfile=/path/to/keyfile
```

If you're using a YubiKey with KeePassXC, you can specify the slot to use:

```bash
~/secrets.kdbx:yubikey=1:23456789
```

## GnuPG

To set a different gpg key as the default for encryption, you can specify the key id:

```bash
~/path/to/gpg/secrets:key=634419040D678764
```

You can control the gpg output format by specifying a file extension:

```bash
# output binary format (default)
pw add GitHub.gpg

# output ASCII-armored format
pw add GitHub.asc
```

# Requirements

## `pw`

```bash
brew install fzf
```

## `pw` plugins (optional):

### macos_keychain

Nothing to install, `security` is already installed on macOS.

### keepassxc

```bash
brew install --cask keepassxc
```

### gpg
