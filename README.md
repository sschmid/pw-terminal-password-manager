# üîê `pw` - Terminal Password Manager powered by `fzf`

`pw` is a command-line password manager unifying trusted password managers
like [macOS Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services),
[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) and [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org) in a single interface within the terminal.
It combines the security of your favourite password managers with the speed and
simplicity of the [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) fuzzy finder and allows
you to interact with [various keychains](#using-multiple-keychains) effortlessly.

# Quickstart

```bash
# create a keychain (.keychain-db for macOS Keychain, .kdbx for KeePassXC)
pw init ~/secrets.keychain-db

# optionally configure keychains in ~/.pwrc so you can access them from anywhere
# otherwise, pw will discover keychains in the current directory
echo '~/secrets.keychain-db' >> ~/.pwrc

# add an entry
pw add GitHub sschmid

# add another entry interactively
pw add

# copy the password directly by providing the name
pw GitHub

# or use fzf to select an entry (-p prints the password instead of copying it)
pw -p
```

If you would like to manage your passwords yourself, you can use `pw` with
GnuPG to store encrypted passwords in a directory:

```bash
# create a keychain
pw init ~/secrets/   # end with `/` for GnuPG
cd ~/secrets

# optionally configure keychains in ~/.pwrc so you can access them from anywhere
# otherwise, pw will discover gpg encrypted passwords in the current directory
echo '~/secrets/' >> ~/.pwrc

# add an entry
# if you haven't configured ~/.pwrc yet, you need to specify the keychain once
# because the directory is empty and pw can't determine the keychain type yet
pw -k ~/secrets add GitHub sschmid

# add another entry interactively
pw add

# output binary format (default)
pw add GitHub.gpg

# output ASCII-armored format
pw add GitHub.asc

# copy the password directly by providing the name
pw GitHub

# or use fzf to select an entry (-p prints the password instead of copying it)
pw -p
```

# How `pw` works

`pw` provides a unified interface to interact with various keychains and forwards
commands to the respective password manager using plugins. Plugins are simple
bash scripts that implement the following functions (see [plugins](plugins)):

- `init`
- `add`
- `edit`
- `get`
- `show`
- `rm`
- `ls`
- `open`
- `lock`
- `unlock`

Password managers may vary in their capabilities, so `pw` provides a
consistent interface by implementing workarounds where necessary.

Here's an overview of which features are supported by each plugin:

# Security Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `pw` supports the macOS `security` command and `gpg` through its plugins,
> which may introduce security risks. These risks arise from the behavior of
> these underlying commands, not from `pw` itself.

## macOS `security` Command

Typically, when accessing keychain items added by other applications, the user
is prompted to `allow` or `always allow` access. However, when keychain entries
are added using the `security` command itself, the command is automatically
granted access to those items without future prompts. This can be a security risk,
because other applications can use the `security` command to access these items
without prompting the user.

`pw` changes this behaviour to reduce security risks by not automatically adding
the `security` command to the keychain's access control list. This way you have
full control over which applications can access your keychain items and decide
whether to allow or deny access on a item-by-item basis.

See [Plugin specific configuration](#macos-keychain) to change this behaviour.

If you decide to change this behaviour, consider the following recommendations:

> [!TIP]
> - Change the keychain settings to require a password after a certain time and
>   activate the option to lock the keychain when the computer sleeps.
> - Lock the keychain after each use to secure it.

```bash
pw lock
```

Additionally, keychain entries can be listed without requiring a password, even
when the keychain is locked. This can expose metadata about the keychain entries
like the name, account, URL and comments. This cannot be prevented by `pw` and
is a limitation of the macOS Keychain. There are workarounds like encrypting the
keychain and only temporarily decrypting it when needed.

## GPG Passphrase Caching

GPG caches passphrases after use, which can allow access to the private key
without re-entering the passphrase.

> [!TIP]
> - Shorten the GPG passphrase caching time by adjusting the `gpg-agent` settings.
> - Kill the GPG agent process to clear the passphrase cache.

```bash
pw lock   # will run 'gpgconf --kill gpg-agent' to kill the GPG agent process
```

Additionally, while GPG encrypts files, the file names can still be listed
without requiring the passphrase, thereby exposing the file names. This cannot
be prevented by `pw` and is a limitation of GPG. There are workarounds like
using a separate encrypted container or using a tool like `tar` to encrypt the
files into a single archive.

## KeePassXC

> [!NOTE]
> KeePassXC, unlike the `security` command and GPG, remains locked when not in
> use and does not have these risks.

# Security Comparison

# Usage

In all following examples, `[<args>]` refers to the optional
arguments `name`, `account`, `url`, `notes` in that order.

When using fzf mode to select an entry, such as when getting, editing,
or removing an entry, you can toggle the entry preview by pressing `?`.
The entry preview shows details like the name, account, url, and notes and
is off by default.

Press `CTRL-Y` on any entry to copy (or print) the details.

## Create keychain

```
pw init <keychain>                 create keychain
```

```bash
pw init ~/secrets.keychain-db   # macOS Keychain
pw init ~/secrets.kdbx          # KeePassXC
pw init ~/secrets/              # GnuPG (end with `/` to create a directory)

# macos_keychain special behaviour
pw init secrets.keychain-db            # will create a keychain in ~/Library/Keychains
pw init "${PWD}/secrets.keychain-db"   # will create a keychain in the current directory
```

## Add entry with name and optional account

```
pw add [<args>]                    add entry. If no args, interactive mode
```

```bash
pw add                                      # add interactively
pw add GitHub                               # add entry with name
pw add Google work@example.com              # add entry with name and account
pw add Google personal@example.com
pw add Homepage admin https://example.com   # add entry with name, account, url
pw add Coveralls "" https://coveralls.io "login via GitHub" # add entry with name, url, notes
```

If a plugin doesn't support multiple entries with the same name,
you can add the account to the name:

```bash
pw add "Google (Work)" work@example.com
pw add "Google (Personal)" personal@example.com
```

## Add entry in group

```bash
pw add Coding/GitHub
pw add Coding/JetBrains
```

## Edit entry

```
pw edit [<args>]                   edit entry. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw edit          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw edit GitHub
```

## Get entry

```
pw [-p] [<args>]                   copy (or print) password. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw GitHub
```

## Show entry

```
pw show [-p] [<args>]              copy (or print) details. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw show          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw show GitHub
```

## Remove entry

```
pw rm [<args>]                remove entry. If no args, fzf mode
```

```bash
pw rm          # starts fzf to select an entry
pw rm GitHub
```

## Generate a password

```
pw gen [-p] [<length>] [<class>]   generate password with given length and
                                   character class (default: 35 [:graph:])
```

```bash
pw gen                  # equivalent to pw gen 35 '[:graph:]'
pw gen 16
pw gen 24 '[:alnum:]'
pw gen 32 '[:digit:]'
```

## Automatic keychain discovery

`pw` automatically searches for keychains in the current directory. This way
you can keep your keychains in the same directory as your project and `pw` will
automatically discover and use them.

## Specifying a keychain

There are multiple ways to specify a keychain:

```bash
# specify keychain using -k for the current command (overrides PW_KEYCHAIN)
pw -k secrets.keychain-db
```

```bash
# specify keychain for the current command
PW_KEYCHAIN=secrets.keychain-db pw
```

```bash
# export default keychain for the current shell
export PW_KEYCHAIN=secrets.keychain-db
pw
```

## Using multiple keychains

`pw` allows you to interact with multiple keychains from different password
managers. This feature is particularly useful when you have keychains stored
in various locations. You can specify different keychains using the `PW_RC`
configuration file, which defaults to `~/.pwrc`.

To use multiple keychains, add your desired keychains to `~/.pwrc`, e.g.:

```ini
[keychains]
	secrets.keychain-db
	~/path/to/myproject.keychain-db
	~/path/to/keepassxc.kdbx
	~/path/to/gpg/secrets
```

After configuring your keychains, continue using `pw` as usual. If no keychain
is specified with `-k` or by setting `PW_KEYCHAIN`, `pw` allows you to select
one from your `~/.pwrc` file using the fuzzy finder.

![pw-fzf](readme/pw-keychains.png)

## Using `pw` in a command or script
Use `pw` to avoid leaking secrets in scripts that you share or commit.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $(pw -p GITHUB_TOKEN)" https://api.github.com/user
```

## Provide passwords via `STDIN`

To avoid password prompts that can interrupt scripts,
you can provide passwords via `STDIN`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid providing passwords in plain text, because they can be exposed in process
  listings, shell history, logs, and through insecure network transmissions, making
  them vulnerable to theft or misuse. Instead, use secure methods like environment
  variables to protect sensitive information.

```bash
echo "${MY_PASSWORD}" | pw init ~/secrets.kdbx
echo "${MY_PASSWORD}" | pw add Google personal@example.com
echo "${MY_PASSWORD}" | pw unlock
```

If your shell supports `STDIN` with here string (like `bash`), you can use it like this:

```bash
pw init ~/secrets.kdbx <<< "${MY_PASSWORD}"
pw add Google personal@example.com <<< "${MY_PASSWORD}"
pw unlock <<< "${MY_PASSWORD}"
```

# Customization

Configure `pw` in `~/.pwrc` with the following options:

```ini
[config]
	password_length = 35
	password_character_class = [:graph:]
	clipboard_clear_time = 45

[plugins]
	$PW_HOME/plugins/gpg
	$PW_HOME/plugins/keepassxc
	$PW_HOME/plugins/macos_keychain

[keychains]
	secrets.keychain-db
	~/path/to/myproject.keychain-db
	~/path/to/keepassxc.kdbx
	~/path/to/gpg/secrets
```

Additionally, you can use environment variables to customize `pw`. They will
override the settings in `~/.pwrc`.

```bash
# Default keychain used when not specified with -k
# otherwise, ~/.pwrc is used to select a keychain with fzf
export PW_KEYCHAIN=secrets.keychain-db

# Default length of generated passwords
export PW_GEN_LENGTH=35

# Default character class for generated passwords
export PW_GEN_CLASS='[:graph:]'

# Time after which the password is cleared from the clipboard
export PW_CLIP_TIME=45

# Path to the configuration file
export PW_RC=~/.mypwrc
```

# Plugin specific configuration

Some plugins support additional configuration options by appending them to the
keychain path after a colon `:`, e.g. `/path/to/keychain:key=value`.

This syntax can be used everywhere a keychain is specified, e.g.:

```bash
pw -k ~/secrets.kdbx:key1=value1,key2=value2
```

In your `~/.pwrc`:
```bash
...
~/secrets.kdbx:key1=value1,key2=value2
...
```

## macOS Keychain

As mentioned in the [Security Considerations](#security-considerations) section,
`pw` won't automatically add the `security` command to the keychain's access
control list to reduce security risks. If you want to add the `security` command
to the keychain's access control list by default, you can set the environment
variable `PW_MACOS_KEYCHAIN_ACCESS_CONTROL` to `always-allow`:

```bash
export PW_MACOS_KEYCHAIN_ACCESS_CONTROL="always-allow"
```

## KeePassXC

If you want to use a key file for unlocking the database,
you can specify the path to the key file:

```bash
~/secrets.kdbx:keyfile=/path/to/keyfile
```
